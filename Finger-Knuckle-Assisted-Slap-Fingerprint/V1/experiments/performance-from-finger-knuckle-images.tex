Each of the simultaneously acquired and segmented finger knuckle images were first evaluated for their individual performance. Fig. \ref{fingerknuckle-performance} illustrates receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for the finger knuckle images acquired from each of ten different fingers. These results indicate that the ring finger knuckle, from both the hands, offers superior performance followed by the performance from the middle finger, and then index finger. The performance from the knuckle from thumbs and the little finger is observed to be relatively poor. This can be largely attributed to the high agility \textcolor{red}{(which are easily deformed)} with the thumb and the little fingers which often results in degradation in the quality of segmented images. Fig. \ref{fingerknuckle-performance} also illustrates the equal error rate (EER) values for the respective finger knuckle images.
