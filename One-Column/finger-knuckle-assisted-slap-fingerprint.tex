\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Billions of fingerprint images are routinely acquired to support e-governance programs and protect national borders using millions of slap-fingerprint acquisition devices that are deployed globally. Several studies from national ID programs like UIDAI \cite{uidai}, and NIST \cite{2002SUMMARYON}, have indicated that ~2\% of the user population may not have usable fingerprints. Finger knuckle patterns are inherently presented during such slap-fingerprint acquisition and can be simultaneously acquired, \textit{without} any additional user inconvenience, and can not only be used to significantly improve accuracy for user identification but also add to traffic flow. This paper develops the first such finger-knuckle-assisted fingerprint identification system for real applications. We systematically develop automated finger knuckle segmentation capabilities under complex backgrounds and in presence of multiple finger knuckles which are observed in such contactless images from the deployed slap fingerprint devices. We also propose a new approach to match such knuckle images and provide comparisons with other state-of-art finger knuckle matching methods. Our experimental results illustrate the significant improvement in performance, by incorporating dynamic fusion capabilities and validating promises for such an approach for real-world deployment. This paper also introduces the worldâ€™s first joint finger-knuckle and fingerprint database, from 120 different subjects, in the public domain to advance further research and development efforts in this area.
